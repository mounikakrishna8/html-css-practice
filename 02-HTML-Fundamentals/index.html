    <h2>The Basic Language of the Web:HTML</h2>
    <p>
      All modern websites and web applications are built using three
      <strong><em>fundamental</em></strong>
      technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are the languages of the
      web.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all about,
      and why you too should learn it.
    </p>
    <h3>what is HTML?</h3>
    <p>
      HTML stands for <strong>H</strong>yper<strong>T</strong>ext
      <strong>M</strong>arkup<strong>L</strong>anguage. It's a markup language
      that web developers use to structure and describe the content of a webpage
      (not a programming language).
    </p>
    <p>
      HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content:
      paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers understand
      HTML and render HTML code as websites.
    </p>
    <p>In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:</p>
    <!-- in the below tags the <ol> tag is the parent element and the <li> tags are the child elements -->
    <ol>
      <li>The opening tag</li>
      <li>The closing tag</li>
      <li>The actual element</li>
    </ol>
    <p>You can learn more at the <href>MDN Web Docs.</href></p>
    <h3>Why should we learn HTML</h3>
    <p>
      There are countless reasons for learning the fundamental language of the
      web. Here are 5 of them:
    </p>
    <!-- we use the <ul>unordered list tag in places where order doesn't matter for example we use it for bullet points instead of numbers -->
    <ul>
      <li>To be able to use the fundamental web dev language</li>
      <li>
        To hand-craft beautiful websites instead of relying on tools like
        Worpress or Wix
      </li>
      <li>To build web applications</li>
      <li>To impress friends</li>
      <li>To have fun ðŸ˜ƒ</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Hopefully you learned something new here. See you next time!</p>
